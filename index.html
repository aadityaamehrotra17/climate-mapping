                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-1">The Revival of Weather Shooting (1896)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-1" class="montserrat-p">Weather shooting began to experience a revival at the end of the nineteenth century, when Albert Stiger, a wine grower and mayor of Windisch-Feistritz in the Austrian province of Styria, installed six such cannons to protect his vineyards in 1896. The absence of hail that summer encouraged him to expand the experiment and 30 cannons were installed on the slopes of the Bacher (Pohorje) Mountains in 1897. Again, no damaging hail fell in the protected area that summer, while other parts of Styria and Carinthia experienced some of the most severe hail in decades. Stiger’s cannons quickly gained publicity in and beyond Austria, with their re-inventor celebrated as a “Styrian Prometheus”.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-2">Introduction to Italy (1899)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-2" class="montserrat-p">In the summer of 1898, Edoardo Ottavi, a deputy to the Italian parliament and editor of an agricultural journal, visited the Styrian cannons and publicized his observations in Italy. Agrarian outlets in Italy soon began discussing the new technology and the first Italian weather shooting association formed in <a class="link" id="link-3-2-1">Arzignano</a> in early 1899. By the of the year, Arzignano counted 446 shooting stations. More associations formed in four other Italian provinces, with 2000 cannons in operation in 1899. Most of these associations were formed on the initiative of individual winegrowers without government support. A first congress on weather shooting was held in November 1899 in <a class="link" id="link-3-2-2">Casale Monferrato</a>, an area that suffered regular hail losses and where cannons had recently been introduced.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-3">Spread in Italy (1900)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-3" class="montserrat-p">The growth further intensified in the following year: by the end of 1900, around 10,000 cannons had been installed across Italy. While some cannons could also be found in central and Southern Italy, notably in the Marche region, most cannons remained concentrated in the Northern parts of the country which saw more hail and where agricultural entrepreneurship, technical innovation, and technical instruction were more developed.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-4">Experiments in Austria (1900)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-4" class="montserrat-p">In 1900, Austrian authorities adopted a more supportive stance towards weather shooting. New experiments let the cannons' effects appear more plausible and the government funded scientific studies and provided discounted powder, ammunition, instruments, and aeronautical support. Provincial governments also supported the installation of observatories equipped with cannons in <a class="link" id="link-3-4-1">Windisch-Feistritz (Stiria)</a> and <a class="link" id="link-3-4-2">Ober-Hollabrunn (Lower Austria)</a>. New stations were also installed in other parts of Styria, Lower Austria, Istria, Tyrol, and Dalmatia, partly with public subsidies, but also on the initiative of local associations and private individuals.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-5">Spread to France (1900)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-5" class="montserrat-p">One of the French delegates at the conference in Casale spread word of the cannons’ success in the Beaujolais region, where a first hail suppression association formed in Denicé in 1900. This installation became a model for other French cannons ranges in the following months and years. In the first decade of the twentieth century, many more French communities saw the creation of hail defense associations, which sparked similar enthusiasm as in Italy.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-6">Congress in Padua (1900)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-6" class="montserrat-p">A second international congress of hail shooting associations was held in <a class="link" id="link-3-6-1">Padua</a> in November 1900. While the organisers aimed to draw an international audience and attracted indeed a number of delegates from other countries, the vast majority of attendees were Italian. Despite the growing number of reports on failures, the general mood at the Padua conference remained positive.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-7">Weather Shooting in Spain (1901)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-7" class="montserrat-p">In Spain, weather shooting never spread to the same degree as around the Alps. Installations were limited to a handful of landowners employing individual or few cannons to protect their own land in the province of Barcelona. The largest Spanish installation was set up in El Plà del Panadès near Barcelona with government subsidies and the support of local landowners. A few cannons were also installed in other provinces.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-8">Weather Shooting in the Russian Empire (1901)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-8" class="montserrat-p">The cannons also attracted attention in the Russian Empire. In 1900, the Russian government sent Georgy Gogol-Yanovsky, who directed the Crown Land Office’s wine cellar in Tiflis to Hungary, Austria, and Italy to study the cannons. In the following year, he installed fourteen cannons on an imperial vineyard in <a class="link" id="link-3-8-1">Napareuli</a>. Another consortium with ten cannons formed on a vineyard in the Crimean town of <a class="link" id="link-3-8-2">Karasubazar</a>, where the owner of a prosperous estate hoped to advance the introduction of hail cannons. The Russian Ministry of Agriculture formed a commission to study weather shooting and welcomed the installation of cannons and exempted their import from duties.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-9">Congress in Lyon (1901)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-9" class="montserrat-p">A third international conference for hail suppression was held in <a class="link" id="link-3-9-1">Lyon</a> in November 1901. By this point, governments were heavily involved in the project. Scientists increasingly got involved in hail cannon research, as well, raising doubts about the cannons' effectiveness. After several years with little hail damage, hail was observed despite faultless shooting. Several delegates at Lyon reported cases where the cannons had been unable to prevent severe hail damage. One event that particularly contributed to discrediting the cannons was a storm which devastated large areas around <a class="link" id="link-3-9-2">Casale Monferrato</a> on May 17, 1901. Weather shooting was largely abandoned in the area after this storm. Another severe storm destroyed large parts of the crops in <a class="link" id="link-3-9-3">Saluzzo</a>, further leading to the demise of the cannons. In France, in contrast, the number of consortia modestly increased following the congress of Lyon.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-10">Congress in Graz (1902)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-10" class="montserrat-p">A final conference organised by the Austrian minister of agriculture in <a class="link" id="link-3-10-1">Graz</a> in 1902 widely discredited the practice in academic and government circles. The majority of delegates, which included around fifty government officials, scientists and experts (but importantly excluded mere “practitioners”) declared the efficacy of weather shooting unlikely. Nevertheless, the Austrian government set up an experimental station in <a class="link" id="link-3-10-2">Windisch-Feistritz</a> in the hope of disproving weather shooting once and for all, as popular support remained unbroken.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-11">Experiments in Italy</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-11" class="montserrat-p">The Italian government also set up two stations to conduct experiments with cannons, and later also bombshells and rockets. Following severe hail damage in 1903 and 1904, the results of the experiments were declared to be negative. The fact that both stations were manned by academic scientists throughout the hail season lent their observation particular weight. By <a class="link" id="link-3-11-1">1904</a>, the enthusiasm with which Italian farmers had embraced the hail cannon turned into outright hostility. The physicist Pietro Blaserna, tasked with overseeing the governmental experiments, claimed that he was the only person still shooting. The Italian parliament became increasingly wary of letting the experiment continue.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-12">Decline of Weather Shooting (1902-1904)</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-12" class="montserrat-p">After a sequence of hailstorms in Austria, Italy, and France in the years between 1902-1904 that caused severe damage, the Austrian and Italian government ceased subsidizing the hail artilleries in 1904. The cannons were largely abandoned there after 1904.</p>
                    <h2 class="montserrat-h2"><a class="link" id="link-3-13">Continued Shooting in France</a></h2>
                    <p id="section-3-13" class="montserrat-p">In France, in contrast, cannons and rockets continued to be used throughout the first decade of the twentieth century and up to the Great War. While most new of the hail defense syndicates formed after 1905 tended to employ high-altitude rockets and disillusionement increased from 1906, associations continued to install new cannons in 1912 and continued to receive subsidies in 1914.</p>
